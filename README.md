# React + TailwindCSS + Vite.js + Projen + AWS 

This repo will scaffold a new React-project using Vitejs to get React and TailwindCSS up-and-running.
And host it in AWS.
Project uses `Projen` to make life easy.

```shell
yarn install
```

Run frontend:
```
vite
```

Deploy:
```shell
cd backend && cdk deploy
```

That is easy, right?
